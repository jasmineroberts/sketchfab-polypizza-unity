# Sketchfab Runtime Fetcher for Unity

This project demonstrates a powerful runtime integration between Sketchfab's API and Unity, enabling dynamic model searches and loading at runtime. Developed in **June 2022**, this system supports multi-word search queries, fetches corresponding 3D models from Sketchfab's extensive library, and loads them seamlessly into a Unity scene during runtime.

## Project Highlights

The code has been used in the following projects:

- **Microsoft's "Speaking the World into Existence" Project**  (https://github.com/microsoft/llmr)
  
- **Reality Bridge â€“ Best Use of Qualcomm Technologies in IoT**

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Multi-Word Search
- Users can input complex, multi-word search queries.
- The integration utilizes Sketchfab's RESTful API to fetch relevant models based on these queries in real-time.

### 2. Seamless Unity Integration
- The fetched models are imported into the Unity environment during runtime.
- Models are automatically processed for compatibility, including proper scaling and positioning.

### 3. User-Friendly Experience
- A simple Unity UI allows users to input search terms and view models as they load dynamically.
- Optimized for performance to ensure smooth runtime operation.
